The hashing algorithms implemented are -
1. Hash Chaining.
2. Linear Probing.
3. Cuckoo Hashing.
4. Double Hashing.

There is a Controller file for each of the hashing algorithms which has the data which I used to test each of the algorithms.
Please run the controller file as a Java Application to run the algorithm
