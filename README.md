# Strategies for dealing with Collisions
The hashing algorithms implemented are - <br></br>
1. Hash Chaining. <br></br>
2. Linear Probing. <br></br>
3. Cuckoo Hashing. <br></br>
4. Double Hashing. <br></br>

There is a Controller file for each of the hashing algorithms which has the data which I used to test each of the algorithms.
Please run the controller file as a Java Application to run the algorithms.
